            <h2>Description</h2>
            <div class="justified-text">The X-ray spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to be produced in a hot coronal region where relativistic electron inverse-Compton scatter the low-energy (optical/UV) photons emitted by the cold accretion disc around a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The slope of the primary X-ray continuum, usually described through a simple power law, is therefore determined by the physical properties of the corona, in particular its temperature and optical depth. Both observational and theoretical arguments suggest a correlation between the X-ray photon index and the accretion rate, whereby systems with higher accretion rates have steeper X-ray spectra as their corona is more efficiently cooled. This topic has generally been addressed by identifying highly accreting objects via multiwavelength diagnostics and then studying their X-ray properties. The aim of this master thesis is to follow the opposite route, starting from the selection of a robust sample of AGN with steep X-ray spectra (Γ &gt; 2.5) based on XMM-Newton archival observations, and then considering ancillary multiwavelength data to investigate whether X-ray supersoft AGN are preferentially found among highly accreting systems. The results will have important implications on the formation of SMBHs in the early Universe and on the X-ray properties of AGN populations at high redshift.</div>

        <div class='section'><h2>Requirements</h2><div>Besides the core courses of the (Observational) Astrophysics path, it is recommended to include in the personal curriculum the “Active galactic nuclei and black holes” course. A basic knowledge of Python is desirable but not strictly necessary, as the required expertise on data reduction and analysis will be acquired as part of the project. The reference papers are provided only to elucidate the broader context of the physical themes that will be addressed during the thesis.</div></div>

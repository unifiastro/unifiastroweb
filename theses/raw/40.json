    "description": "Since the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1995 more than 6000 exoplanets have been detected nowadays. This indicates that planet formation is a robust mechanism and nearly every star in our Galaxy should host a system of planets. However, many crucial questions about the origin of planets are still unanswered: How and when planets formed in the Solar System and in extra-solar systems? What is the reason of the huge variety of architectures of extrasolar systems? And what chemical composition do Solar System bodies inherit from their natal environment?\n\nThe master thesis project is aimed to answer these outstanding questions by studying the planet formation site, i.e. planet-forming disks around young Sun-like stars (i.e. young stars with mass similar to our Sun). The master student will analyse observations taken with state-of-the-art interferometers working at millimetre and centimetre wavelengths, such as ALMA and VLA, to detect the emission from gaseous molecules and dust grains in planet-forming disks at different stages of evolution (from 104 years to a few Myr) down to scales of a few au, i.e. comparable to the size of our Solar System (50 au).",
